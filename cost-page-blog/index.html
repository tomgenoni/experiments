                        The average cost of a house cleaner is between $130 and
                        $160 per cleaning. This price largely depends on the
                        size of the home, level of cleaning needed, and the
                        products used. Most cleaning services or cleaning
                        professionals will provide an estimate based on square
                        footage, but will only offer an exact cost after
                        performing a walk-through of the space.

                        Professional house cleaning services are available for
                        private homes, rental properties, multiunit buildings,
                        businesses, rental move-ins or move-outs, home sale
                        preparation, event and party cleanup, and more. You can
                        use a house cleaner for a one-time service or set up a
                        recurring cleaning service such as a weekly or biweekly
                        cleaning. Things that affect the overall average cost of
                        a house cleaning service include the square footage of
                        the residence or office, the number of rooms and
                        bathrooms that need to be cleaned, whether you want a
                        general cleaning or a deep cleaning, and whether you
                        want the cleaner to use eco-friendly cleaning products.
