Global styles
=============

This directory contains global style rules that are included on every Thumbprint page.
There are mostly the base elements of the UI system, like colors, typography, and icons.

If in doubt, err on the side of not adding any new files to this directory. Remember, components
can be CSS-only. If you just want to add some styles without any JavaScript, but they're not
generic enough to go on every page, make a CSS-only component in thumbprint/components.
