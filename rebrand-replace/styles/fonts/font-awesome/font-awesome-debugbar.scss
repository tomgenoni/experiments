// Font Awesome is ONLY included here for the PHP Debug Bar to use.  It has not been approved for
// use by design on the production Thumbtack web site.
//
// Unfortunately, the debug bar requires a custom font family name, which they implemented using
// very hacky means that don't allow for other customization of Font Awesome.  They are also fairly
// committed to using it, since stylesheets both within and external to the debug bar project are
// hard-coded to use that non-standard font family name.
//
// The problem with this is that the upstream maintainers of Font Awesome are actively rejecting any
// attempts to allow users to customize the font family name.  Their suggested "solution" is to
// reproduce portions of the Font Awesome source code within your own source code:
//
//     https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/6113
//     https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/pull/10406
//
// We therefore implement their "solution" by setting package.json to use an EXACT Font Awesome
// version.  To upgrade Font Awesome, you must manually update this file and dependent files, as
// noted further below.

// Get default variable values in order to get $fa-version
@import "../../../../node_modules/font-awesome/scss/variables";

// Set the prefix and font family to namespace this for PHP Debug Bar.
$fa-css-prefix: phpdebugbar-fa;
$fa-font-family: PhpDebugbarFontAwesome;

// Use external Font Awesome CDN:
$fa-font-path: "https://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/#{$fa-version}/fonts";

// Fail if we are not the expected version.  If you run into this error, you need to update the
// font-awesome-debugbar-implementation.scss file to support the new Font Awesome version.  Follow
// the directions in that file.
@if $fa-version != "4.7.0" {
    @error "Font Awesome PHP Debug Bar adaptation requires updating.";
}
@import "font-awesome-debugbar-implementation";
